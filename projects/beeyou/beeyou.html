                    BEEYOU was an individual project <br>assignment
                     for a student run course<br> at UC Berkeley
                      that focused on <br>graphic design and branding. <br>
                      The goal of the course was to <br>ultimately 
                      come up with a <b>brand<br> concept for 
                      a self-made company.</b>

                    BEEYOU is a <b>care-package</b> brand<br>
                     that creates uniquely themed <br>packaging
                      and items that revolve<br> around any emotion
                       its users<br> may have.
                       <br><br> 
                       By creating a care-package
                        for <br>all occasions, happy or not, 
                        BEEYOU<br> strives to <b>normalize emotions</b><br>
                         in a world where it may not be<br> easy
                          to do so. <br>You and the people you love <br>
                          deserve a treat no matter what <br>you’re feeling, 
                          and BEEYOU is <br>here for you.

                    BEEYOU was designed with a <b>soft,<br> 
                    friendly yet vibrant</b> atmosphere<br> in mind. 
                    The logo uses a pictorial<br> mark instead of the classic<br>
                     letter-mark or combination logo: <br>
                     the result was not only a memorable<br> mascot with an emotional aspect,<br>
                      but also a play on the letter B.
                      <br><br>
                      At first, I had drafted a few pastel<br> palettes,
                       but ended up going with<br> slightly more saturated 
                       colors to<br> represent the <b>variety of emotions<br> and also
                        for more visual accessibility</b>.<br> 
                        I also chose tomake assets that built<br> on each other, 
                        including finishing<br> sentences or including similar<br> captions
                         to keep brand cohesiveness<br> and connect each emotion <br>with each other.

                <p>
                    I created BEEYOU during the height of
                     Covid-19 where emotions were running high,
                      people couldn't see each other for months, and mental health
                       was more important than ever. Personally, I was struggling 
                       a lot with the death of my beloved grandparents. 
                       BEEYOU was a reflection of my growth to accept 
                       that it was okay that I wasn’t okay. Due to the situation,
                        I regret I wasn’t able to put more time into this
                         project so I’d like to <br>revisit it someday.
